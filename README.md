# data_structures
In this repository, we will be solving data structures problems


- Sorting Algorithm
    * Selection sort: In selection sort, we find for minimal number in array and we place it infront of array.
                        Sort array ascending wise.
    * Bubble sort: In bubble sorting, we push maximum number to last with adjacent swap. Place maximum first in 
                        array. Opposite to selection sort.
